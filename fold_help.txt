Fold help: Temporary doc I put together to help me remember vim fold commands while I'm learning them

Open Fold: make a fold available for toggling, and put it in folded state
zf: open a fold (either do in visual mode, or normal mode followed by a line-based motion)
:[startline],[endline]fold -- for example, :5,10fold will fold lines 5-10, inclusive

Existing Fold Manipulation: open/close existing folds
za: toggle open/close fold
zc: close a fold
zo: open a fold
zR: open all folds
zM: close all folds

Fold Deletion: Removes folds (no longer folds these lines when running "Existing Fold Manipulation" commands
zd: delete a fold
zE: delete all folds in the whole buffer

Turn Folds On/Off: Simple toggle for all folds (sort of behaves like zR and zM, but easier to remember)
zn: disable folding
zN: enable folding

Side notes:
keep in mind, folds are NOT considered a document edit. This means that hitting undo will NOT undo setting the fold. Instead, it will undo your last edit, irrelevant of any folds
