look up some cool vimscript functions in other people's vim configs
go through vimrc, find something I don't understand, and improve upon it or keep it the same but at least know what it means a little better now
make a "go to definition" feature which is language-dependent (based on file extension of current file) (note, this would make vim significantly closer to an all-out IDE)
(sometime) read through the vim manual until I find something interesting enough to add to my vimrc
